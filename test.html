 <p><img src="divafhatsune.jpg" alt="divafhatsune.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:600px;">
<p> Hello! This website is dedicated to preserve all custom charts from Project Diva F/F2nd before servers are shut down. This is quite an ambitious project and won't be complete for a while. For now I only have a handful of F2nd charts,only avalible with a japenese copy of the game.</p>



<h1> How It Works</h1>

<p> There are two types of charts. Encrypted and decrypted. Encrypted works for real hardware, decrypted works for an emulator (RPCS3).
